This is an reference implementation of PCMHost using Alsa audio driver for AGC (audio gain control) feature support, in order to pass Skype certification for targeting platform Linux-x86. 
Please check and make sure you have 32 bit alsa lib downloaded and installed in your machine. e.g. for ubuntu user, you can type  sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev to install alsa lib.

Some source code for alsa function calls are encapulated in the libSkypeAlsaWrapper.so library. This library should be generated first by typing the "make" command under the voicepcmhost-alsa/SkypeAlsaWrapper directory. Please note, you need to define your own COMPILER_BARRIER in SkypeAlsaWrapper/CompilerBarrier.h for the corresponding device in order to guarantee memory ordering for SMP CPUs even on non-coherent archs like ARMv7 and MIPS..

Building PCMHostAlsa:
make - Build 
build options: 
	TARGET_ARCH=(default i686, see sid/buildfiles/arch directory for other TARGET_ARCH options) - build for specific architecture
	verbose=(0 | 1, default 0) - be verbose
make clean - clean build

Running command:
under voicepcmhost-alsa/build directory, type:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../SkypeAlsaWrapper ./voicepcmhost-alsa
