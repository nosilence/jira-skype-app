This directory contains cmake files that define GNU-flavored compilation/linkage
options that we want to use across our build products. The intent is to (ultimately)
have multiple different GNU-flavored config files that can be different depending
on platform, and that can be picked up when cross-compiling (through toolchain
files). This is a work in progress, of course.
